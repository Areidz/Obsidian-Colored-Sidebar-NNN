# Obsidian-Colored-Sidebar v2.0.0
## A Colored Sidebar CSS Snippet for Obsidian.

### *Create a [colorfully cascading](https://youtu.be/rAkerV8rlow) Obsidian sidebar!*

![Example](./example.png)

This snippet targets folders beginning with numbered prefixes, and applies full
color formatting based on the root colors listed inside the snippet. The prefixes are both
customizable and extensible; feel free to change, add, and remove them based on
your own titles and vault structure! By default I have a range of 8+1 colors,
however I've provided some other common colors as a starting point for your own
customization. Just swap out the color variable names in the prefix groups.

Goes great with the [Iconize](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-iconize) plugin!

*Inspired by the "Coloured Folders" snippet by Lithou.*
