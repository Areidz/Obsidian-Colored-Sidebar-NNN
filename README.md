# Obsidian-Colored-Sidebar v1.0.0
## A Colored Sidebar CSS Snippet for Obsidian.

Create a <a href="https://youtu.be/rAkerV8rlow">colorfully cascading</a> Obsidian sidebar!

This snippet targets folders beginning with numbered prefixes, and applies full
color formatting based on the root colors listed inside the snippet. The prefixes are both
customizable and extensible; feel free to change, add, and remove them based on
your own titles and vault structure! By default I have a range of 8+1 colors,
however I've provided some other common colors as a starting point for your own
customization. Just swap out the color variable names in the prefix groups.

Goes great with the [Iconize](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-iconize) plugin!
